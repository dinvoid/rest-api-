This repository contains a REST API for managing books using MongoDB as the database. The API supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and allows you to retrieve, add, update, and delete books from a MongoDB collection.

The API is built using Node.js and Express, and it uses the MongoDB driver for Node.js to connect to the database. The API follows RESTful principles and uses HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on books.

The API includes endpoints for retrieving a list of books, retrieving a single book by ID, adding a new book, updating an existing book, and deleting a book.

This API is meant to be used as a starting point for building more complex book management systems. Feel free to fork and modify the code to suit your needs."
